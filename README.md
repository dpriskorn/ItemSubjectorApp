# Wikidata Topic Curator
This is a simplified rewrite of ItemSubjector into a webapp 
to help wikimedians curate scientific articles with topics.

## Inspiration
This app was inspired by [topictagger](https://github.com/lubianat/topictagger), AuthorDisambiguator and Scholia.
The bootstrap layout was inspired by [Wikidata Lexeme Forms](https://lexeme-forms.toolforge.org/)

## What I learned
* the syntax of flask and FastAPI seem very similar
* jinja2 templates are really cool
* pycharm has very nice html editing support :)
* chatgpt is very good at helping with flask apps, which really sped up development
* bootstrap is nice, I don't have to fiddle with CSS at all, just choose a few classes and it's good enough to get out the door
* chatgpt can generate all the javascript I'll ever need for simple projects like this one. Very nice not having to learn and keep that in memory at all.

## Effort
This software is a product of about two weeks work of time.
